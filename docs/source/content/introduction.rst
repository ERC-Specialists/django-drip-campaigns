Introduction
=============

Django Drip Campaigns Project is an open source app to create drip campaigns for email using 
`Djangoâ€™s admin <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/>`_
interface and a User queryset. This means that using this app, you are able to easily schedule and send emails to the 
registered users, creating querysets in a friendly interface.  
For example, you can very quickly configure your app to send a periodic email to the users that haven't logged in in 
a day or more, send a custom email to the users that registered more than a week ago, etc. To do this, you only need to define one or more querysets in the admin page.

This project is a fork of the one written by `Zapier <https://zapier.com/z/qO/>`_.
